# Ask

- There is 2 main things needed to clarified in the Ask phase.

## Identify the problem you are trying to solve

- Identify the differences between annual members and casual riders.

## Identify the stakeholders

- Primary stakeholders: Lily Moreno, marketing analytics team
- Secondary stakeholders: Cyclistic executive team

# Prepare

- In this stage, we answer 6 questions:

## Where is your data located? How is the data organized?

- Data is downloaded from [Cyclistic's website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and stored in a folder named `Data` in the same directory as this notebook.
  Data is organised in 12 `.csv` files, each file contains data for a month in 2022.

## Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?

- Reliable/Relevant: The data is publicly available and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. with the appropriate license. Second, the data is organised in a way that allows for easy analysis and has been checked for any issues with bias or credibility. The data has also been verified for integrity and is compliant with data-privacy regulations. Finally, the data is relevant to the questions of the case study, as it contains information related to how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
- Original: The original data, has been downloaded directly from the [source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and not been modified in any way.
- Comprehensive: The data contains information related to how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes, which will allow for a comprehensive analysis.
- Current: The data used is current, as it contains data from 12 months of 2022. Last updated is 03 January 2023.
- Cited: The data is cited, as it has been downloaded from the [source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and the source has been cited in the report.

## How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?

- License, Security: The data is secure and publicly available and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
- Privacy: The data is compliant with data-privacy regulations.
  > ... note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information. This means that you wonâ€™t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
- Accessibility: The data is accessible, as it is stored in a folder named `Data` in the same directory as this notebook.

## How did you verify the dataâ€™s integrity?

- Integrity checks can be found in **3.4** belown including
  - All data in the dataset has the same format
  - No duplications of data & primary key `ride_id` is unique
  - No null values
  - Both Casual & Member riders have 365 days of rides
  - Whether to keep or remove the outliers

## How does it help you answer your question?

- The dataset for each year contains 13 columns & the last column `casual_member`, which flags whether the rider is a casual rider or a member, is precisely the key to find the differences between the 2 groups.
- Potential differences the analysis may find are:
  - Duration of rides
  - Preferences of bike type
  - Usage trends in ride duration, ride frequency, and day of the week that rides are taken
  - The locations of popular stations and the most popular routes

## Are there any problems with the data?

- There are some problems with the dataset as below:
  - There are rides with duration less than 60s - which can be removed for [this reason](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
  - There are rides with duration more than 24 hours - which can be removed for 2 reasons: [stolen bikes issues](https://help.divvybikes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033123412-My-bike-was-lost-or-stolen) and [this issue](https://help.divvybikes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033484791-What-if-I-keep-a-bike-out-too-long-)
  - Some rides have NULL station names - which can be removed for [this reason](https://divvybikes.com/system-data)
  - Some rides have TEST in their station names - which can be removed for [this reason](https://divvybikes.com/system-data)

# Process

- In this step, there are 4 main questions to be addressed:

## What tools are you choosing and why?

- I choose to work with SQL Server because it is a great free alternative to BigQuery to work with database. A copy of sql file will be placed in the same folder as this report under the name `Process.sql`.
- I also use Python in Jupyter notebook to clean data.

## Have you ensured your dataâ€™s integrity?

1. All data in the dataset must have the same format

- A data file consists of 13 colums, when be imported into SQL Server should be:
  - `ride_id`: VARCHAR(a)
  - `rideable_type`: VARCHAR(b)
  - `started_at`: DATETIME
  - `ended_at`: DATETIME
  - `start_station_name`: VARCHAR(c)
  - `start_station_id`: VARCHAR(d)
  - `end_station_name`: VARCHAR(e)
  - `end_station_id`: VARCHAR(f)
  - `start_lat`: DECIMAL(o, r)
  - `start_lng`: DECIMAL(p, s)
  - `end_lat`: FLOAT
  - `end_lng`: FLOAT
  - `member_casual`: VARCHAR(g)
- To find [a;g] and [o,r], I create a Python function to find the max length of 6 column in the dataset, to parse the number to `VARCHAR()` in `SQL` and a function to check if that column has the same max length in 12 files..

  ```python
  def getMaxLen(yr):
    if yr < 10:
        yr = '0' + str(yr)
    path = './Data/2022' + str(yr) + '-divvy-tripdata.csv'
    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    if df[col].dtype == 'object':
        return df[col].str.len().max()
    else:
        return df[col].astype(str).str.len().max()
  def checkSameMaxLen():
    for i in range(1, 12):
        for j in range(i+1, 13):
            if getMaxLen(i) != getMaxLen(j):
                return "12 columns of " + col + "do not have the same max length."
    return "12 columns of " +  col + " have the same max length."
  def getMaxLen12():
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, 13):
        if getMaxLen(i) > max:
            max = getMaxLen(i)
    return "Max length of column " + col + " is " + str(max)

  ```

- To find [r;s], I create a Python function to find min value and max value of 12 column in the dataset, to find the range of the column values.

  ```python
  def getMax(yr):
   if yr < 10:
       yr = '0' + str(yr)
   path = './Data/2022' + str(yr) + '-divvy-tripdata.csv'
   df = pd.read_csv(path)
   return  df[col].max()

  def getMax12():
     max = getMax(1)
     for i in range(2, 13):
         if getMax(i) > max:
             max = getMax(i)
     return "Max of column " + col + " is " + str(max)

  def getMin(yr):
     if yr < 10:
         yr = '0' + str(yr)
     path = './Data/2022' + str(yr) + '-divvy-tripdata.csv'
     df = pd.read_csv(path)
     return  df[col].min()

  def getMin12():
     min = getMin(1)
     for i in range(2, 13):
         if getMin(i) < min:
             min = getMin(i)
     return "Min of column " + col + " is " + str(min)
  ```

- **From these functions, I've come to these data types belove:**

  - `ride_id`: VARCHAR(16)
  - `rideable_type`: VARCHAR(13)
  - `started_at`: DATETIME
  - `ended_at`: DATETIME
  - `start_station_name`: VARCHAR(64)
  - `start_station_id`: VARCHAR(44)
  - `end_station_name`: VARCHAR(64)
  - `end_station_id`: VARCHAR(44)
  - `start_lat`: DECIMAL(18, 16)
  - `start_lng`: DECIMAL(18, 16)
  - `end_lat`: DECIMAL(18, 16)
  - `end_lng`: DECIMAL(18, 16)
  - `member_casual`: VARCHAR(6)
