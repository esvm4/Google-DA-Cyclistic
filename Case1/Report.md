# Ask

- There is 2 main things needed to clarified in the Ask phase.

## Identify the problem you are trying to solve

- Identify the differences between annual members and casual riders.

## Identify the stakeholders

- Primary stakeholders: Lily Moreno, marketing analytics team
- Secondary stakeholders: Cyclistic executive team

# Prepare

- In this stage, we answer 6 questions:

## Where is your data located? How is the data organized?

- Data is downloaded from [Cyclistic's website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and stored in a folder named `Data` in the same directory as this notebook.
  Data is organised in 12 `.csv` files, each file contains data for a month in 2022.

## Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?

- Reliable/Relevant: The data is publicly available and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. with the appropriate license. Second, the data is organised in a way that allows for easy analysis and has been checked for any issues with bias or credibility. The data has also been verified for integrity and is compliant with data-privacy regulations. Finally, the data is relevant to the questions of the case study, as it contains information related to how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
- Original: The original data, has been downloaded directly from the [source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and not been modified in any way.
- Comprehensive: The data contains information related to how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes, which will allow for a comprehensive analysis.
- Current: The data used is current, as it contains data from 12 months of 2022. Last updated is 03 January 2023.
- Cited: The data is cited, as it has been downloaded from the [source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and the source has been cited in the report.

## How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?

- License, Security: The data is secure and publicly available and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
- Privacy: The data is compliant with data-privacy regulations.
  > ... note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information. This means that you wonâ€™t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
- Accessibility: The data is accessible, as it is stored in a folder named `Data` in the same directory as this notebook.

## How did you verify the dataâ€™s integrity?

- Integrity checks can be found in **3.4** belown including
  - All data in the dataset has the same format
  - No singularities in the dataset
  - No duplications of data & primary key `ride_id` is unique
  - Both Casual & Member riders have 365 days of rides

## How does it help you answer your question?

- The dataset for each year contains 13 columns & the last column `casual_member`, which flags whether the rider is a casual rider or a member, is precisely the key to find the differences between the 2 groups.
- Potential differences the analysis may find are:
  - Duration of rides
  - Preferences of bike type
  - Usage trends in ride duration, ride frequency, and day of the week that rides are taken
  - The locations of popular stations and the most popular routes

## Are there any problems with the data?

# Process

- In this step, there are 4 main questions to be addressed:

## What tools are you choosing and why?

## Have you ensured your dataâ€™s integrity?

## What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?

## How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?

# Analyse
